# INFO201 Project: Fuel Economy and Its Impact on the Environment
This is our repository for our final project for INFO201 (19AU).

We will be using the skills we learned in the class to explore real world problems. In this case, we are exploring the correlations between among different trends of the U.S.'s automobile fuel efficiency as well as comparing them to the trends of emissions.   

As for right now, the project is in progress. We expected to deliver it through a website form informative visualizations coming from official datasets from the EPA.

This is our [project proposal](https://github.com/xudav18/INFO201/wiki/Project-Proposal) and [technical report](https://github.com/xudav18/INFO201/wiki/Technical-Report) under the wiki section, and our [Shiny app](https://kevinxz.shinyapps.io/nogas/).
