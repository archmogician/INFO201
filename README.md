# INFO201 Project
This is our repository of the project for INFO201 2019 fall.

We will be using the skills we learned in the class to explore real world problems. In this case, we are exploring the correlations between among different trends of the U.S.'s automobile fuel efficiency as well as comparing them to the trends of emissions.   

As for right now, the project is in progress. We expected to deliver it through a website form informative visualizations coming from official datasets from the EPA.

This is our [project proposal](https://github.com/xudav18/INFO201/wiki)
