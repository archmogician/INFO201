# **Usage of R to Implement project**

We used the R language various libraries to power our project. We used libraries such as plotly, shiny, and dplyr to create the different components in our application.

We used the plotly library to create the data visualizations which are a very integral part of our project. We created this to help the users of our applications to get a clear idea about the data set and this problem of automotive sales, trends, and fuel consumption.

We used dplyr to wrangle through the selected dataset to get the data that was needed to make conclusions. It helps to get the specific data which helps us get to certain conclusions.

We used shiny to create the web application which the user interacts with. This application is used to display all the data that we have collected and found. We also display all of our conclusions with the help of our shiny application.
