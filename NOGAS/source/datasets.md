# **Usage of Dataset**


We decided to utilize datasets from 2 reports created by the United States Environmental Protection Agency(EPA), the  “Automotive Trends report” and the “Air Trends report”. Via [EPA Automotive Trends Report site](https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/download-data-automotive-trends-report) and [EPA Air Trends Report site](https://www.epa.gov/air-trends)

We used the datasets to collect data from 1975 to 2018. Each observation in the datasets contains multiple variables, including the attributes of the automotive in that year, the market share of different engine technologies, etc, and also the amount of particular population coming from the highway vehicle. The dataset are quite big because they also contain manufacturers' information and pollutants from other sources, which we wouldn’t need for this project. To extract the data that we wanted to research and needed, we created a subset of the dataset using data wrangling with the help of dplyr. Our dataset gave us observations over the years of different fuel technologies and the air trends, allowing us to easily use for our project. This helped us get enough observations and data to draw conclusions and answer our questions.

We were successfully able to collect data and answer the questions that we had using this dataset. The credibility of this dataset helped us to trust every single deduction that we made from it.
