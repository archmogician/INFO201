# **Introduction**

### **Problem situation**

While rapid industrialization has improved our standard of living significantly, the pollution it produces has detrimental effects on societies and ecosystems on a global scale. Additionally, because of
  the widespread implementation of newfound technology, such as the
  invention of cars, almost every person on this planet not only
  contributes but is affected by this issue on a daily basis, making
  them a direct stakeholder. Despite the complications this brings to
  our progression as a civilization, many remain conflicted when weighing
  the convenience of such industrialization with the dangerous long-term
  effects it leaves. Even with its unethical reasoning, society holds fast
  onto harmful technology that could potentially cause harm to the
  environment for its short-term benefits. Using the envisioning cards,
  we can discuss specific ones such as "Un-targeted Use", "Future
  Stakeholders" and "Indirect Stakeholders". Although these technologies
  were't intentionally designed to harm the environment, ultimately,
  future generations become an indirect and future stakeholder since
  their future home's living conditions become threatened. Another indirect
  stakeholder would be wildlife and marine animals because although they
  don't necessarily use these technologies, their habitats are affected by
  the harmful effects of them. Numerous other studies on the climate and fuel
  efficiency have been conducted by other companies and organizations.
  These works are helpful towards us as we are able to use them as
  inspiration/reference when visualizing the datasets. We are motivated to
  work on this issue, and care about it as this is an existential issue that
  has the ability to wipe out our entire species, but it seems that many do
  not care due to the fact that it is happening slowly and not
  instantaneously. It is up to our generation to amend the problems and
  evolves to rely on cleaner, greener technology.


### **Research Questions**
1. How has fuel efficiency and other attributes of automotive in the U.S. changed over time?
2. What kind of correlation exists between the change in automotive technology and their fuel efficiency and attributes?
3. Are there any comparisons that can be made with fuel efficiency and the air quality?
