### Introduction
* **Problem situation**: While rapid industrialization has improved our standard of living significantly, the pollution it produces has detrimental effects on societies and ecosystems on a global scale. Additionally, because of the widespread implementation of newfound technology, such as the invention of cars, almost every person on this planet not only contributes but is affected by this issue on a daily basis. Despite the complications, this brings to our progression as a civilization, many remain conflicted when weighing the convenience of such industrialization with the dangerous long-term effects it leaves. Even with its unethical reasoning, society holds fast onto harmful technology that could potentially cause harm to the environment, and thus damaging living conditions on Earth as a whole.

 * **What is the problem?**  For the current time, while society as a whole transition from gas combustion engines to hybrid and pure electric vehicles like those produced by Tesla, and the primary bulk of vehicles on the road being of combustion engines, fuel economy remains an important figure. Vehicles that depend on combustion engines to create power emit carbon monoxide and various other particulates into the air. Ultimately, this creates long-term effects on the environment and living conditions on Earth.

 * **Why does it matter?**  Environmental change is one that has been overlooked for many generations but has become a key one for ours and has become an existential threat. If we are to continue down the same polluting manner, the consequences will be devastating: it is estimated that a 2 Celsius increase could mean “more heatwaves, a ten-fold increase in Arctic ice-free summers and a complete wipe-out of the world's coral reefs, home to millions of species” bringing a myriad of ramifications to all inhabitants of Earth (UN Environment Program). As the ecosystem is in a cycle, polluting it will inevitably lead to worsened living conditions for ourselves, such as causing acid rain, Additionally, as humans are not an interplanetary species at the moment (go Elon Musk!), if Earth becomes uninhabitable it will lead to the demise of us all.
 * **How will it be addressed?** : We understand that change cannot happen overnight. From the early era of steam engines to the current combustion engines and to the futuristic all-electric power sources, innovation takes time. However, we hope that by displaying trends and data, we can coerce people to speed up this transition to greener energies and ultimately a greener economy.

### Research Questions:
* How has a fuel efficiency of automotive in the U.S. changed over time?
Are there any correlations between the trends of fuel efficiency and the trends of emissions?

### Possible Data Sets:
* Automotive trends report from EPA. This dataset contains data on every new light-duty vehicle model sold in the United States since 1975. This dataset presents current and historic data that provides a comprehensive overview of the automotive industry here in the U.S. It also contains data of CO emissions. link: https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/download-data-automotive-trends-report. There are 44 observations, one observation for each year. There are 8 attributes, which are attributes of the new cars in that year.
